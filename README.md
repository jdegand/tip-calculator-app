## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

My JavaScript really came together when I allowed myself a global variable.  The custom tip % box was a pain.  

### Continued development

This project does not lend itself well to semantic markup and accessibility.
